### Hi there 👋

My name is Robson, and I'm a Computer Scientist passionate about all things Unix and DevOps. When I'm not crushing bugs or building dreams, I can be found backpacking 🧗🏿‍♂️around the world or practicing martial arts 🤼‍♂️. From Brazil, living in Canada and traveling within the UTC-3 timezone.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on fully automating a project involving PXE UEFI deployment for Oracle Linux servers, 100% offline.
- 🌴 I recently built a Foreman project using Ansible, check it out [here](https://github.com/enemy100/Foreman-deploy)
- 🙋🏻‍♂️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving automation tools or Linux!
  - Send me your ideas at robsongomesbc@gmail.com
