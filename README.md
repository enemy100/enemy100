### Hi there 👋

My name is Robson, and I'm a Computer Scientist interested in all things Unix & DevOps.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on fully automating a project involving PXE UEFI deployment for Oracle Linux servers, 100% offline.
- 🌴 I recently built a Foreman project using Ansible and Puppet.
- 🙋🏻‍♂️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving automation tools or Linux!
  - Send me your ideas at robsongomesbc@gmail.com
